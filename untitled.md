## Comparing AWS and LCD Temperature readings : Preliminary results from the 2018 data.

For Bollwerk the incoming radiation clearly explains the bias - which is perfectly 0 during hours of darkness. Truly an incredible correlation.

Looking at the four figures above Bollwerk, we see a less straightforward relationship. the peaks in deviations from the mean do not follow the radiation curve in a straightforward fashion and in two cases do not do so at all.
